  SECTION 1: Introduction

      <h3 class="mb-3">From Web Portfolio to Ionic Mobile App</h3>
      <p>
        This project began as a standard Express.js and Handlebars portfolio website.
        It included simple routes, static pages, and JSON-driven project data.
        For our group tutorial presentation, we are transforming this web portfolio
        into a fully mobile Ionic application.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal of the transformation is to demonstrate how a traditional web project
        can be rebuilt using Ionic's modern mobile components, responsive layout system,
        and built-in gesture support. By recreating this portfolio inside Ionic, we show
        how developers can take an existing website and convert it into a mobile-friendly,
        app-like experience.

      <h3 class="mb-3">What We Are Adding With Ionic</h3>
      <p>
        Each page from the original portfolio is enhanced using Ionic's UI features:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>ion-header &amp; ion-toolbar</strong> for native-style app navigation</li>
        <li><strong>ion-tabs</strong> to allow quick switching between Home, About, Projects, and Contact</li>
        <li><strong>ion-card</strong> to format content cleanly on mobile screens</li>
        <li><strong>ion-list &amp; ion-item</strong> to modernize the Projects and Skills sections</li>
        <li><strong>ion-grid</strong> for responsive layouts on tablets and phones</li>
        <li><strong>Gestures</strong> such as swipe and scroll animations</li>
        <li><strong>Theming</strong> to match the original portfolio's colours and personality</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Instead of static content, Ionic allows the portfolio to feel interactive and
        closer to a real mobile app experience.

  SECTION 3: Why We Chose Ionic
  Explains the reasoning behind the transformation and how it benefits developers.
--}}
<section class="mb-5">
  <ion-card class="mb-3">
    <ion-card-content>
      <h3 class="mb-3">Why Ionic?</h3>
      <p>
        Ionic is ideal for this project because it allows us to reuse web technologies
        such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while producing an application that feels
        native on iOS and Android. It is a practical example of how developers can
        modernize older applications without rewriting everything from scratch.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the end of the transformation, this portfolio will run smoothly in a browser,
        as a mobile PWA, or inside a native shell using Capacitor.

  SECTION 4: Summary
  Wraps up the purpose of the page and gives a clear explanation for what the class will 
  learn during the demonstration.

<section class="mb-5">
  <ion-card class="mb-3">

      <h3 class="mb-3">Summary</h3>
      <p>
        This About page outlines the purpose of our project: converting an Express-based
        portfolio into an Ionic mobile application. Throughout the demo, we show how
        Ionic components replace traditional HTML, how routing changes with tabs, and
        how gestures and animations create a more polished user experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        This transformation highlights the flexibility of Ionic and gives our class
        a real example of how to migrate a simple web portfolio into a mobile-ready,
        app-like interface.

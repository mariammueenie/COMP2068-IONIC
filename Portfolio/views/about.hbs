<section class="mb-4">
  <h3>Who I Am</h3>
  <p>
    Hi! I'm <strong>Jane Doe</strong>, a developer based in Ontario with a passion 
    for problem-solving, clean UI design, creative coding, and building 
    modern interactive web experiences.  
    I love working at the intersection of design + logic — especially when
    a project lets me experiment with animation, APIs, or new frameworks.
  </p>

<section class="mb-4">
  <h3>Programming Experience</h3>
  <p>
    I have hands-on experience with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>JavaScript (ES6+), Node.js, Express</li>
    <li>HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Design</li>
    <li>Bootstrap, Ionic components, Handlebars</li>
    <li>REST APIs, asynchronous workflows</li>
    <li>Debugging, GitHub workflows, local development environments</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I enjoy projects where I can combine front-end polish with solid 
    back-end logic, especially when there’s a chance to add animations or
    interactive elements.

  <h3>Surprise</h3>
  <p>
    I love adding unexpected details to my projects — a hidden feature, an 
    animated element, or a small twist that makes people smile.  
    This “Surprise” section is here so I can turn it into an
    <strong>Ionic accordion, modal, or animation</strong> later during our demo.
